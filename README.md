---------------------

To get started:

1. Setup a virtual environment (e.g., conda)

2. Install requirements:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt --index-url=https://packages.idmod.org/api/pypi/pypi-production/simple
   ```

3. Run an experiment (requires COMPS credentials):
   ```
   cd EMOD-Generic-Scripts/model_covariance01/experiment_covariance01
    python make01_param_dict.py
    python make02_lauch_sims.py
    python make03_pool_brick.py
    ```

4. Make figures:
    ```
    cd EMOD-Generic-Scripts/model_covariance01/figure_attackfrac01
    python make_fig_attackrate.py
   ```

---------------------

To build the documentation locally, do the following:

1. Create and activate a venv.

2. Navigate to the root directory of the repo and enter the following

    ```
    pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
    ```

Simulations examining RDT impact using Ghana as an example context. Work
presented as part of Feb 2022 co-chair.

Parameters in the baseline model were adjusted to fit observed timeseries of
measles incidence. Poisson-based likelihood function is maximized over one free
parameter that scales total incidence and is interpreted as a reporting rate.

Important features include:

- Multi-node network used to represent the country of Ghana at the 10km scale.
- Network infectivity contagion transfer between nodes.
- Acquisition-transmission covariance.
- Pre-specified calendar of supplemental immunization activities (SIAs).
- Maternally derived immunity.
- Overdispersion of the infection rate.
- Maximum simulation duration based on elapsed time.
- Weighted agents to represent multiple individuals per agent.
- Age-based immunity initialization to approximate endemic transmission.
- Infectivity reservoir to represent persistent exogeneous importation.

Test scenario projects incidence forward and implements outbreak response SIAs
based on observed incidence.

Important features include:

- SQL-based event reporting of symptomatic incidence.
- Spatial varying reporting rates sampled from a beta distribution.
- Response interventions created dynamically using python in-process.

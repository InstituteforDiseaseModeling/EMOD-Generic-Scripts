This example demonstrates the implementation of superspreading behavior and its
visualization using transmission trees. These simulations use a constant R0
value of 1.5 and one of two variance levels for the secondary transmission
rate: constant or exponential. A constant rate has all infected individuals
tranmsit with a Poisson rate equal to the R0 value; an exponential rate has
each infected individual transmit with a Poisson rate that is drawn from an
exponential distribution with mean equal to the R0 value.

Each simulation has a default network of 16 nodes (4-by-4 grid) that are well
mixed using the network infectivity feature. Simulations are implemented as
multi-core (two cores per simulation) to demonstrate logging and transmisssion
between nodes hosted on different cores (note that cores may or may not be
co-located on a common machine.)

An outbreak is initialized by a constant importation pressure of infected
individuals. There is no age structure, vital dynamics, or waning. All
simulations run for 1000 time steps of until total infectivity falls to zero.

Data for the explicit transmission tree is generated by applying infection
labels based on the unique ID of the infecting agent. Logging is provided by
the event database (SQLite format) that records these infection labels. Each
record provides a unique ID for the infected agent and the unique ID for the
infecting agent. Infected individuals imported to initialize the outbreak have
their infecting agent's ID label set to zero.
